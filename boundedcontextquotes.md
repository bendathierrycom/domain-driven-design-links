#### Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain-Driven Design (by Scott Millet and Nick Tune 2015)

* p54: Bounded contexts are used to form a **protective boundary** around models that helps to prevent software from evolving into a BBoM.
* p119:  A bounded context is defined based on **team’s language,** and physical artifacts. 
> 
> p126: Treat bounded contexts like the **borders of a country**. Nothing should pass into the bounded context unless it goes through the border control and is valid. Just like countries where people speak a different language, so does the code within your bounded context. 
> 
> p128:  There are two aspects of a problem domain that you can use as a guide to **identifying bounded contexts** — terminology and business capabilities. 
> 
> p129:  A **single team** should be responsible for a bounded context, whether that crosses one or many applications or departments. So structure teams around bounded contexts; form product and services groups rather than trying to mirror the departmental structure of the business. Ensure that teams are **responsible for a bounded context from presentation through domain logic and to persistence.**
