##### [Patterns, Principles and Practices of Domain-Driven Design by Scott Millet and Nick Tune 2015](https://github.com/bmihovski/software-development-ebooks-1/blob/master/%5BPatterns%2C%20Principles%2C%20and%20Practices%20of%20Domain-Driven%20Design%20Kindle%20Edition%20by%20Scott%20Millett%20-%202015%5D.pdf)


* p54: Bounded contexts are used to form a **protective boundary** around models that helps to prevent software from evolving into a BBoM.
* p119: A bounded context is defined based on **team’s language,** and physical artifacts. 
* p126: Treat bounded contexts like the **borders of a country**. Nothing should pass into the bounded context unless it goes through the border control and is valid. Just like countries where people speak a different language, so does the code within your bounded context. 
* p128: There are two aspects of a problem domain that you can use as a guide to **identifying bounded contexts** — terminology and business capabilities. 
* p129: A **single team** should be responsible for a bounded context, whether that crosses one or many applications or departments. So structure teams around bounded contexts; form product and services groups rather than trying to mirror the departmental structure of the business. Ensure that teams are **responsible for a bounded context from presentation through domain logic and to persistence.**
* p131: **Unlike a subdomain**, a bounded context is a concrete technical implementation that enforces boundaries between models within an application. Bounded contexts exist in the solution space and are represented as explicit domain models in a context.
* p136: There are **no rules** for defining the boundaries of a model and therefore bounded contexts. Instead you should base bounded contexts around linguistic boundaries, team organization, subdomains and physical deployments. 
* continue p148

* p239: By explicitly defining a BOUNDED CONTEXT within which a model applies and then, when necessary, defining its relationship with other contexts, the modeler can **avoid bastardizing** the model.
* p304: Code reuse between BOUNDED CONTEXTS is a **hazard to be avoided**. Integration of functionality and data must go through a translation.
* contine p310
