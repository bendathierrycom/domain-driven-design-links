# Great quotes for the concept of Published Language 

Mission of this overview is to bring great quotes for the concept of the Published Language, in order to get a better understandig of this fundamental DDD integration pattern.

> The translation between the models of two bounded contexts requires a common language. Use a well-documented shared language that can express the necessary domain information as a common medium of communication, translating as necessary into and out of that language. Published Language is often combined with Open Host Service. [Evans 2003](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/o-aa-standard/DDD-strategic-patterns.html#_midway_patterns)

* Published Language (PL): “The interacting bounded contexts agree on a common language (for example a bunch of XML schemas over an enterprise service bus) by which they can interact with each other.”
