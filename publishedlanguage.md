# Great quotes for the concept of Published Language 

Mission of this overview is to bring great quotes for the concept of the Published Language, in order to get a better understandig of this fundamental DDD integration pattern.

> The translation between the models of two bounded contexts requires a common language. Use a well-documented shared language that can express the necessary domain information as a common medium of communication, translating as necessary into and out of that language. Published Language is often combined with Open Host Service. [Evans 2003](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/o-aa-standard/DDD-strategic-patterns.html#_midway_patterns)

* Published Language (PL): “The interacting bounded contexts agree on a **common language** (for example a bunch of XML schemas over an enterprise service bus) by which they can interact with each other.”

* Many **industries establish	published	languages	in the form	of data interchange standards**. Project teams also develop their own for use within their organization.

##### [Domain-Driven Design Crew Context Mapping](https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping)
* Widely known examples for a Published Language are **iCalendar or vCard**. Published language is often combined with an open-host service.

##### [BPM2DDD: A Systematic Process for Identifying Domains from Business Processes Models](https://www.mdpi.com/2674-113X/1/4/18/htm)
* The Document printing relationship type was defined as open host service and published language, as this is a **generic** context that can be used by any other context inside the organisation.

##### [Opus: DDD Concepts and Patterns – Context Map](https://opus.ch/ddd-concepts-and-patterns-context-map/)
* Further development of the open host service may lead to (the use of) a published language that has it’s own bounded context. The language could be a **model defined by some industry association or state** for example.

* Therefore we need a common, standard, communication Interchange Language that any system con use to communicate with our system, we need a published language:
If possible, use an **industry standard language**;

* Real world examples of published languages are **MathML** for representing mathematical formulas and **GML** for representing geographical features in geographical information systems.
