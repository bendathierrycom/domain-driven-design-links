# Great quotes for the concept of Published Language 

Mission of this overview is to bring great quotes for the concept of the Published Language, in order to get a better understandig of this fundamental DDD integration pattern.

> The translation between the models of two bounded contexts requires a common language. Use a well-documented shared language that can express the necessary domain information as a common medium of communication, translating as necessary into and out of that language. Published Language is often combined with Open Host Service. [Evans 2003](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/o-aa-standard/DDD-strategic-patterns.html#context-map)

* Published Language (PL): “The interacting bounded contexts agree on a common language (for example a bunch of XML schemas over an enterprise service bus) by which they can interact with each other.”

* p22:  If there is a single **“invention”** Evans delivers to the software development community, it is the Ubiquitous Language. At a minimum he brought the Ubiquitous Language out of the dusty archives of design wisdom.

* p24:  Domain-driven design proposes a better way to get the knowledge from domain experts to software engineers: by using a ubiquitous language. 
* p25:  It's crucial to emphasize that the ubiquitous language is the language of the business. ... No technical jargon!
* p211: The use of a ubiquitous language is the cornerstone practice of domain-driven design. It is essential for domain knowledge discovery, communication and effective solution modeling.

* p:  These domain experts use **company- or industry-standard terminology**. In DDD, this vocabulary is called the Ubiquitous Language. As developers, you want to understand this vocabulary and not only use it when speaking with domain experts but also see the same terminology reflected in your code.
