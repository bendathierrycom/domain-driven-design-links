# Great quotes for the concept of Published Language 

Mission of this overview is to bring great quotes for the concept of Ubiquitous Language, in order to get a better understandig of this fundamental DDD concept. Bounded context and the ubiquitous language are the foundation of DDD.

> A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software. [Evans 2003](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/o-aa-standard/DDD-strategic-patterns.html#context-map)

* p48: The **language of the Business**. Developers should think in domain terms and concepts, not technical terms, to avoid the need to translate from business jargon into technical jargon. 
* P49: Not only must the development team learn the explicit terms and concepts from the business, but they must collaborate with the domain experts to define the assumed or implicit **concepts that may not have terminology**. These concepts must be named by the entire team and included in the shared UL. 
* p130: Bounded context and the ubiquitous language are the **foundation of DDD**.

* p24:  Domain-driven design proposes a better way to get the knowledge from domain experts to software engineers: by using a ubiquitous language. 
* p25:  It's crucial to emphasize that the ubiquitous language is the language of the business. ... No technical jargon!
* p211: The use of a ubiquitous language is the cornerstone practice of domain-driven design. It is essential for domain knowledge discovery, communication and effective solution modeling.

* p:  These domain experts use **company- or industry-standard terminology**. In DDD, this vocabulary is called the Ubiquitous Language. As developers, you want to understand this vocabulary and not only use it when speaking with domain experts but also see the same terminology reflected in your code.
