# Great quotes for the concept of Ubiquitous Language 

Mission of this overview is to bring great quotes for the concept of Ubiquitous Language, in order to get a better understandig of this fundamental DDD concept. Bounded context and the ubiquitous language are the foundation of DDD.

> A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software. [Evans 2003](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/o-aa-standard/DDD-strategic-patterns.html#context-map)

* p24:  Domain-driven design proposes a better way to get the knowledge from domain experts to software engineers: by using a ubiquitous language. 
* p25:  It's crucial to emphasize that the ubiquitous language is the language of the business. ... No technical jargon!
* p211: The use of a ubiquitous language is the cornerstone practice of domain-driven design. It is essential for domain knowledge discovery, communication and effective solution modeling.
